# BigData-and-CloudComputing


## Overview
This repository contains two distinct projects that leverage Apache Spark for large-scale data processing and machine learning tasks. Each project is designed to demonstrate the power of Spark in handling complex computations and large datasets efficiently.

### Projects

1. **Linear Regression and Gradient Descent**
   - Implements linear regression using both the normal equation and gradient descent optimization techniques.
   - Utilizes Spark RDDs and Breeze for matrix operations and inversion.
   - Includes RMSE calculation for model performance evaluation.

2. **Matrix Multiplication using Spark**
   - Demonstrates efficient matrix multiplication using Spark's distributed computation capabilities.
   - Handles large matrices that may not fit into the memory of a single machine, showcasing Spark's scalability.

## Installation
- **Apache Spark**
- **Scala**
- **Breeze** (for numerical operations in the linear regression project)

## Usage
Go to the individual project directories for detailed instructions on running each project:
- `Linear_Regression/`: Contains the implementation and instructions for the linear regression and gradient descent project.
- `Matrix_Multiplication/`: Contains the implementation and instructions for the matrix multiplication project.
